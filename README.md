# Java-PacMan

This Java code implements a simple version of the classic Pac-Man game using the Swing framework. The game board is built from a tile map that defines walls, food, Pac-Man, and ghosts. The game updates on a timer (creating a game loop) and responds to user key events to change Pac-Manâ€™s direction.
